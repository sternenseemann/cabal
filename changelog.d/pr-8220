synopsis: Fix generation of Path_ modules with relocatable
packages: Cabal
prs: #8220
issues: #8219
description: {

The generation of the functions `minusFileName` and `splitFileName`
are now in the same conditional block as their call,
preventing generation of inconsistent Paths_ files
where those functions are used but not defined.

}
